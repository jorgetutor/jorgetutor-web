## Agility, Innovation, and Leadership

I'm a Software Engineer focus on helping people improving their skills and achieve their goals. After more than 10 years dedicated to software projects, leading work teams, and helping organizations to develop successful products, I have discovered that non-technical areas are as much as important and relevant as technical areas.

I speak from my own experience as an employee, as a teammate, as an entrepreneur... as a person. I read, experiment, learn, rehearse, make mistakes, retest, fail early, analyze and start again! Little by little, I am developing a method that I share through keynotes, courses, and my blog.
