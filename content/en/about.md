## Agility, Innovation, and Leadership

I’m a Software Engineer focused on helping people improve their skills and achieve their goals. 

After **more than 15 years dedicated to software projects**, leading work teams, and helping organizations to develop successful products, I have discovered that non-technical areas are as much as important and relevant as technical areas.

I speak from my own experience as an employee, as a teammate, as an entrepreneur… as a person. I read, experiment, learn, rehearse, make mistakes, retest, fail early, analyze, and **start again!** Little by little, I am developing a method that I share through keynotes, courses, and my blog.
