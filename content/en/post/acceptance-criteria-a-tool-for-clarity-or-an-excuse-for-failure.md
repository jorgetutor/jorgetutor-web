summary: "It wasn’t in the AC!, A classic excuse—but was it unclear, or just convenient?
Good AC define the *what*, not the *how*. But clarity is subjective. Teams must refine, challenge, and think beyond checkboxes. AC are a *guideline*, not a safety net.  
How do you handle AC conflicts?"

*On a regular work inspection, a few days before the sprint ends:*  

- *"It doesn’t work."* - The QA team rejects a feature.
- *"It works fine; that part wasn’t specified."* - The developer replies.
- *"The feature doesn’t work like the user expected."* - The product owner adds
- *"But, it meets the acceptance criteria!"* - The developer frowns.

*Silence. A debate brews. One side argues it *should have been specified*, the other insists *it was clear enough**.

Who is right? The truth is, that **everyone interprets ‘clear’ differently.**  

- **If AC are too vague:** Teams make assumptions, leading to misunderstandings.  
- **If AC are too strict:** Developers might meet them *literally* but miss real user needs.  
- **If teams rely only on AC:** They lose accountability for critical thinking and problem-solving.

## **What is the Acceptance Criteria (AC)?**  
The Acceptance Criteria (AC) define the conditions a product, feature, or user story must meet to be considered complete. They serve as a **contract between business and development teams**, ensuring everyone understands what "done" really means.  

## Why Acceptance Criteria Matter
AC define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete. They ensure:  
- **Clarity & Alignment** – Everyone understands what success looks like.  
- **Reduced Risk** – Issues are caught early, not after release.  
- **Objective Evaluation** – Features can be tested against concrete conditions.  
- **Scope Control** – Helps prevent last-minute scope creep.  
- **User-Centric Focus** – Ensures we build what users actually need.  

Good AC prevents misunderstandings, sets expectations, and keeps projects on track. But if they're **too vague**, they **lead to confusion**. If they're **too rigid**, they **limit creativity**. And when conflicts arise, AC can become a **double-edged sword**—a tool for clarity or an excuse for failure (“but it wasn’t defined!”). 

## What Makes AC Good?

**Bad AC:** *"The login system should prevent too many failed attempts."* (*How many? What should happen?*)

**Good AC:** *"When a user enters an incorrect password 3 times, they should see a message: ‘Your account is locked for 15 minutes.’"*  

**All stakeholders** must agree that the AC are:  

- **User-focused** – Aligns with actual needs.  
- **Aligned** - They align with **business and technical feasibility**.  
- **Clear** – Simple and easy to understand.  
- **Concise** – No unnecessary details.  
- **Complete** - They cover **all** essential aspects of the feature.  
- **Flexible** - They provide **enough detail to avoid misunderstandings**, but not so much that they dictate implementation.  
- **Specific** – Defines success in measurable terms.  
- **Testable** – Can be objectively verified.  

## Who Owns Acceptance Criteria? 
It's a shared responsibility:  
- **Product Owners** draft AC based on business and user needs.  
- **Development Teams** refine them to ensure technical feasibility.  
- **Scrum Masters** facilitate discussions to clarify gaps.  
- **Business Analysts or Clients** may contribute to complex requirements.  

## Takeaways  
- *Ambiguity is a shared failure.* If it’s unclear, it’s everyone’s responsibility to clarify it early.  
- *AC define the *what*, not the *how*.* Teams must have the freedom to implement solutions.  
- *"Not specified" doesn’t mean "not needed."* Think beyond checkboxes—does the feature truly solve the problem?  

**Next time someone says, "It wasn’t in the AC," ask:** *Was it truly unclear, or was it just convenient?*  

What’s your experience with AC conflicts? How do you handle them?
