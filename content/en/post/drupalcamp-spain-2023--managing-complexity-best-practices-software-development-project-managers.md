Software development projects are inherently complex, requiring management skills to balance competing priorities such as deadlines, quality, and stakeholder expectations. To be successful, managers must be able to navigate these challenges while keeping their teams motivated and focused on project goals.

In this session, we explore and discuss strategies for managing the top challenges that managers face in software development projects.

## Managing Project Scope

**What** is included in the project.

### Main Issues

- Lack of definition on requirements
- Unclear/incomplete list of requirements (but fixed price!)
- False agreements: Time and Budget over Scope first, then all Scope demanded!
- *Scope Creep*

### Tips

- Set Clear and Comprehensive definition of: Objectives, Requirements, Deliverables, Assumptions, Constraints, and **Exclusions**!
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): user stories, epics
- Monitor and Control (scope creep!)
- Project Management tools: shared board, Transparency

## Ensuring Time Delivery

**When** is the project delivered

### Main Issues

- Unrealistic Deadlines
- Unmanaged Scope Creep / Change request
- Unmanaged Resources constraints and Dependencies
- Unmanaged Risk Management
- Unforeseen events (illness, disasters)
- Technical challenges

### Tips

- Constraints and dependencies management in advance (all teams)
- Shared Calendar: Milestones, Sprints, Bank holidays/Vacations…
- Sprints must be milestone oriented (all teams)
- Iterative and Incremental development
- Realistic deadlines (+ MARGIN!)
- Identify risks

## Managing Project Budget

The **total projected costs** to complete a project over a defined scope and a period of time

### Main Issues

- Unrealistic budget (Scope, Complexity)
- *Scope creep*
- Resources constraints
- Lack of visibility into spending
- Changing requirements
- Lack of previous experience
- Uncertainties
- Fixed-Price Contracts

### Tips

- Realistic Budgets (Scope, Complexity)
- Manage change
- Learn from experience (yours and others)
- Track/Review spending regularly: communicate with Stakeholders (Transparency)
- Agile contracts: 
  - Time & Materials
  - Time & Materials with spending ceiling, 
  - By Sprint (Story points)
  - Fixed Profit (cost/hour + profit)
  - “Money for nothing. Changes for free” (changes same size)

## Managing Stakeholders Expectations

Those whose interests will be positively or negatively affected as a result of project execution

### Main Issues

- Personal misalignment

### Tips

- Define a clear Backlog refinement process 
- Invest time clarifying requirements
- Share previous experience and solutions
- Regular communication
- Be realistic
- Bad news as soon as possible
- Build trust every day. Trust is hard to gain and easy to lose!
- Engage!
- Shared Goals! WIN-WIN situations

## Managing Change

Strategies, plans, actions and steps that focus on project change impact.

### Main Issues

- Impact on schedule and budget
- Scope Creep

### Tips

- Communicate effectively
- Get buy-in from the team
- Set realistic expectations
- Manage scope creep effectively
- Identify and mitigate technical risks
- Update the project plan

## Managing Team Communication

Encompass the exchange of information between all the individuals in the project.

### Main Issues

- Duplicated information on different channels
- Large teams

## Ensuring Software Quality

Capability of a software product to conform to requirements.

### Main Issues

- Not clear / Ununderstood requirements
- Poor design
- Coding errores
- Integration problems
- Testing challenges
- Unrealistic expectations
- Changing requirements

### Tips

- Define and document quality standards (Definition of Done)
- Implement a quality assurance (QA) process
- Use automated testing tools
- Monitor software quality metrics: code coverage, static analysis
- Empower a culture of quality
