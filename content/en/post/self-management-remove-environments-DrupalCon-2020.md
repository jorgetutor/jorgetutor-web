## Why Self-Management in Remote Environments

### Flexible Working is Becoming the New Normal

- It is Increasing everywhere: Between 2005 to 2017, there was a 159% increase in remote work (US).
- It attracts and Retains Talent: It is one of the most effective and non-monetary ways to retain employees. 
- It is Good for Business: Productivity can increase in a company because of greater flexibility.
- Remote Workers Are More Productive: Fewer distractions and interruptions, less stress from no commute.
- It is Here to Stay: Finally, in a study conducted by Condeco Software on 2020, 41% of global businesses surveyed say they already offer some degree of remote working, while 60% provide flextime opportunities that allow employees to choose when to start and end their workday. 

Upwork’s “Future Workforce Report” predicts that 73% of all teams will have remote workers by 2028.

### Remove Work does not Work Out of the Box

- Enabling a remote workforce is not “business as usual”.
- There are critical differences in managing in-office and remotely: communication, culture, and management must adjust. How do we transition to remote work?

### Tips for a Successful Remote Transformation

#### Organizations

1. Establish a remote leadership team: Count on experts with remote experience who will document challenges in real time.
2. Establish a Handbook: Develop a single source of truth, where all important process will be documented.
3. Establish a Communications Plan: For example, always-on video conference room (come and go), async communication.
4. Minimize your Tool Stack: Define clear instructions for the use of these tools.
5. Drive change: Transition is a process.

#### Employees

1. Carve out a dedicated workspace: And use it purely for work purposes .
2. Separate work from personal life: Being at home most of the day, does not mean you’re available.
3. Engage with People: There is no office to influence spontaneous communication.
4. Respect the routine, experiment with change: Not everyone shares the same peak hours of energy and focus
5. Roll with the changes: Transition is a process.
