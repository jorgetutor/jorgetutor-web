Everyone listens.

Sometimes the plan is cryptic to outsiders, but not to the crew. They may sometimes speak in code, drop indirections, even joke - but they all get it (they are focused on the conversation).

They may disagree vehemently, but they never lose sight of the goal.

It's not about ego. It's about: "We win together or not at all."

And the coordination? Snappy. Clear. Minutes, not hours.

Even the newest or quietest voice is heard - and sometimes followed.

Because insights can come from anywhere.

What if someone misses the meeting? No problem. They're quickly briefed on the most important points.

Meeting is dangerous, so you only meet when it counts.

With purpose.

With the right people.

No one is there just to be there-they understand the mission.

That's the kind of alignment I want in my meetings:

Clear goal. Focused invite list. Decisions made quickly. Everyone respected.

It's a few days late, but..:
May the 4th be with you!

PD: Note about the picture, maybe it's not the best meeting, but it's pretty iconic, right? :)
