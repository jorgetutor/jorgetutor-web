*Somewhere between validating an issue and rewriting a spec, I had to remind myself:* *"You're not the developer anymore."*  

As a former software engineer turned IT manager, resisting the urge to jump in and "just do it myself" has been one of the hardest lessons to learn.  

In *The Making of a Manager*, [Julie Zhuo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-zhuo/) explains that great managers don’t just add value—they **multiply** it. That means improving **purpose, people, and processes** instead of doing the work yourself. But here’s the catch: When you're skilled at something, stepping back feels *unnatural*.  

I’ve come to realize that my "speed" as a manager (developer) is an illusion. It’s not fair to compare my flexibility—changing requirements on the fly—to my team's structured workflow. And let’s be honest: skipping documentation or planning because I "know what needs to be done" is cheating.  

It’s like a football coach jumping onto the field to replace the goalkeeper. If that happens, the problem is much bigger than who's standing in the net.

### **The Ego Trap**  
One of the hardest things to admit as a manager is that **your expertise is no longer your most valuable asset**, your ability to **empower others is**. The ego whispers, *"You're still the best at this. You could solve it faster."* But if you’re coding, fixing, or micromanaging, ask yourself:  

- Are you helping—or just proving you can still do it?  
- Are you adding value—or preventing someone else from growing?  
- Are you saving time—or actually slowing the team down?  

### **The Real Job of a Manager**  
Many organizations reduce management to **task assignment, time tracking, and cost control**—basically, administrative work. But real leadership is about:  

- **Shaping Culture** – The way your team operates, collaborates, and innovates starts with you.  
- **Strategic Alignment** – Ensuring that what’s being worked on is what truly matters.  
- **Long-Term Growth** – Developing your people, not just managing workloads.  

### **How Do You Know You’re Holding the Team Back?**  
One way I check myself is by watching for signs of the [Karpman Drama Triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle):  
- **Victim** – “Why is everything on me?” → Reality: Have I empowered the team?  
- **Persecutor** – “Why can’t they just do this right?” → Reality: Have I set them up for success?  
- **Rescuer** – “I'll just fix it myself.” → Reality: Am I solving problems or creating dependency?  

A manager’s role isn’t to **do**—it’s to **enable**. The best way to measure impact? Look at how well your team performs without you.  

If you’re a manager, what helped you shift from **adding** value to **multiplying** it?
