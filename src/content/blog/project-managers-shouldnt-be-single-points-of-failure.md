Too many teams rely on project managers as the **central hub** for every decision and communication. This might feel “organized” in the short term, but in reality, it creates a **bottleneck** and a **single point of failure (SPOF)**—a fragile system where everything slows (or stops) if one person isn’t available.

- **A great PM doesn’t manage every message**—they enable communication and decision-making at all levels. They focus on mid- and long-term success, identifying risks and opportunities, not micromanaging every interaction.

- **If your team can’t function without a PM present**, something is broken. High-performing teams must distribute responsibility, ensuring alignment without dependence.

- **Stop the "Doers vs. Thinkers" mindset** (a failure of Taylorism). Knowledge workers should contribute ideas, not just execute tasks.

Solutions:
- Build a culture of **direct collaboration**—cut out unnecessary middle steps.
- Ensure teams **engage directly with stakeholders**, reducing unnecessary gatekeeping.
- Encourage **shared ownership** so that knowledge and decision-making aren’t centralized.

If you were to disappear from your team for a week—would they still operate smoothly? If not, it’s time to rethink how work is structured.

What’s your experience with decentralizing project management?
