Let’s be real—**no one wants a controlling boss, client, or even parent.** We all want autonomy, trust, and the space to do our best work.  

But here’s the hard truth: **micromanagement is often a shared responsibility.**

It’s easy to blame a controlling manager, but before you do, ask yourself:  
- Am I keeping my **progress** visible?  
- Am I raising **risks** early enough?  
- Am I making it easy for my manager to **trust** me?  

Because here’s the thing: **Micromanagement isn’t just about control. It’s about fear.**  
Fear of failure. Fear of surprises. Fear of unmet expectations.  

If your manager constantly asks for updates, they’re likely reacting to past experiences where silence led to disaster. If they’re always checking in, it might be because the last time they didn’t, things fell apart.  

The good news? **You can stop micromanagement before it starts.**  

- Use management tools like GitLab or Asana to **keep progress transparent**.  
- Reflect daily on blockers so they **don’t become last-minute crises**.  
- Share work early and often—**don’t wait until it’s too late** for feedback.  

When you proactively communicate, you remove uncertainty. And when there’s no uncertainty, trust grows.  

**Don’t feed the micromanagement monster.** Transparency gives both you and your manager the space you need to do your best work.  

PS: **Some people are chronic micromanagers, no matter what you do.** If you’re stuck with someone who refuses to trust or delegate, it might be time to find a better place.  

Are you contributing to the problem or the solution? What strategies have helped you find the right balance?
