## Hello, I'm Jorge Tutor

I'm a Software Enginier specialized in helping **tech leaders** and **managers** navigate complexity and achieve their full potential.

For over 15 years, my role has been turning technical challenges into reality. I’ve led complex digital projects involving Salesforce integrations, Microsoft Dynamics, custom APIs, and demanding startup environments. I’ve seen firsthand how <strong>talented managers can feel uncertain in the tech world</strong>, and how brilliant teams can get stuck in a cycle of delays and frustration.

As co-owner and manager of Metadrop, one of [top Drupal Development & Consulting companies in Europe](https://metadrop.net) ecosystem, I learned one thing:you need a system to guide your experts, collaborate with clients, manage expectations, and **deliver results**. Those are the systems I share.


## Are These Challenges Slowing Your Project Down?

The modern tech landscape is a difficult place to navigate. It's a world of hidden challenges that can undermine even the most capable leaders. Do you ever feel that:

- You feel like an imposter in technical meetings, hesitant to challenge timelines because you're worried you'll ask the "wrong" question.
- You're trying to figure out how **Artificial Intelligence** impacts your team, separating the genuine opportunities from the distracting noise.
- You're in a client meeting or a technical review, struggling to challenge estimations or manage expectations because you **lack the specific tech knowledge**?
- Your team's on-time **delivery rate is unpredictable**, and you're not sure which levers to pull to fix it without disrupting the experts doing the work?
- You lose productive hours to rework because of **vague requirements or miscommunication** between the client and your development team?
- Your project plans are vulnerable to **scope creep and budget overruns**, forcing difficult conversations that damage client trust?

**The problem isn't a lack of skill**, but a lack of the right tools for this unique environment.


## A Practical Path to Confident Leadership
My philosophy is simple: you don't need to be a coder to be a great tech leader. You need the clarity to ask the right questions and the systems to build a high-performing team.

Here is how I can help you on your journey:

<h3><span class="text-[#1978e5] pr-2">⇨</span><strong>Consulting</strong> & <strong>Coaching</strong></h3>
	
When you need more direct, **personalized support**, I offer direct support to diagnose the problem and give you the tools to solve it.

- **1-on-1 Strategy for Leaders**: This isn't generic coaching. It's a strategy session focused on your team's challenges. We'll build your personal playbook for handling difficult client negotiations, making informed technical decisions, and improving your team's specific KPIs.

- **Team Workshops**: Are inefficient processes causing friction and delays? I run hands-on workshops with your team to install proven systems (like Agile, RACI, etc.) designed to reduce rework, improve communication clarity, and increase deployment frequency.

For deeper dives into specific topics, the [blog](/blog) is where I share longer-form articles, case studies, and frameworks. It's a free resource to help you tackle your most pressing challenges.


## This Is What Happens When Clarity Meets Leadership
Applying practical principles creates a tangible shift in how your team operates and how you feel as a leader.

My clients and readers learn to guide their teams out of "development paralysis" and finally launch that critical project. They implement simple feedback loops that increase the adoption of new features, because the team is finally building what users need. They successfully realign projects that were heading for disaster, saving months of wasted effort and building momentum for the entire organization.

This is more than just theory. This is the predictable outcome of leading with confidence.
