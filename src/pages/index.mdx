## Hello, I'm Jorge Tutor

I'm a Software Enginier specialized in helping leaders and managers navigate challenges and achieve their full potential.

I’ve seen firsthand how <strong>talented managers can feel uncertain in the tech world</strong>, and how brilliant teams can get stuck in a cycle of delays and frustration.

My work is dedicated to changing that. I share clear, practical, and honest insights to help you lead your team and deliver results. The best place to start is with my weekly newsletter.

## Leading in Tech Shouldn't Be This Hard
The modern tech landscape is a difficult place to navigate. It's a world of hidden challenges that can undermine even the most capable leaders.

Maybe you feel like an imposter in technical meetings, hesitant to challenge timelines because you're worried you'll ask the "wrong" question. Perhaps you're fighting fires on a project that's stuck in chaos, with missed deadlines and features nobody seems to want. Or you're trying to figure out how Artificial Intelligence impacts your team, separating the genuine opportunities from the distracting noise.

If any of this sounds familiar, know this: *You are not alone, and it is not your fault*. 

**The problem isn't a lack of skill**, but a lack of the right tools for this unique environment.


## A Practical Path to Confident Leadership
My philosophy is simple: you don't need to be a coder to be a great tech leader. You need the clarity to ask the right questions and the systems to build a high-performing team.

Here is how I can help you on your journey:

When you need more direct, **personalized support**, I work with a select number of leaders. If you are interested in exploring how we could work together, the best way to start a conversation is to [connect with me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgetutor/).

<h3><span class="text-[#1978e5] pr-2">⇨</span>Join My <strong>Weekly Newsletter</strong></h3>

This is the heart of my work. Each week, I send out one actionable email designed to be your toolkit for growth. No fluff. Just practical advice to make tech leadership more understandable, so you can walk into any meeting with confidence.

<h3><span class="text-[#1978e5] pr-2">⇨</span>Read the <strong>Blog</strong></h3>

For deeper dives into specific topics, the [blog](/blog) is where I share longer-form articles, case studies, and frameworks. It's a free resource to help you tackle your most pressing challenges.


## This Is What Happens When Clarity Meets Leadership
Applying practical principles creates a tangible shift in how your team operates and how you feel as a leader.

My clients and readers learn to guide their teams out of "development paralysis" and finally launch that critical project. They implement simple feedback loops that increase the adoption of new features, because the team is finally building what users need. They successfully realign projects that were heading for disaster, saving months of wasted effort and building momentum for the entire organization.

This is more than just theory. This is the predictable outcome of leading with confidence.
